# GOALS

## Set up online accounts
  
  - Github.com : you should have already done this by now.
  - LinkedIn : if you don't have a LI account, start one and start building it.  See Job Search section below for some tips.  We shall discuss this more later in this program.
  - Slack.com 
    - Setup Slack client on your desktop (both Windows and Linux if you have both)
    - Setup Slack client on your phone
    - Review functionality.  You may ask for help from slackbot. Try it with `/help`
    - What channels are there?  What are they for? 
    - Direct messaging and 1-to-many direct messaging.  Try it with one or multiple class mate or instructors.
    - Direct message yourself about any reminders to yourself.
    - Try threaded conversations to avoid clutter.  Look for a chat symbol on a message.
    - Have fun with emoji's. Emoji's are preferred as they reduce messages and adequately express the feeling or response.

#### Udemy HTML5 Intro Course (free)

  If you prefer watching a video, you may sign up for Udemy and go through the course below.  Just complete the HTML portion.  Proceed to CSS3 portion only if you have completed all Week 1 projects.

  [HTML5 and CSS3 Fundamentals](https://www.udemy.com/html5-fundamentals-for-beginners/)

## HTML Projects    

  1. [About Jon Arbuckle](./03-Projects/Project1/Jon%20Arbuckle.md)
  2. [Steve Jobs Fansite](./03-Projects/Project2/Steve%20Jobs.md)
  3. [The Breakfast Restaurant](./03-Projects/Project3/Breakfast.md)
  4. [Hotel Room Service](./03-Projects/Project4/RoomService.md)
  5. [Become a Programmer, Travel the World](./03-Projects/Project5/Programmer.md)

  When writing HTML, please run validation on it.  A decent validator is a Firefox Add-on called HTML Validator.  Once enabled, it shows your mistakes in the Validator tab in Dev Tools.  There's nothing like that in Chrome.  On Chrome, you may use the plugin [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/html-validator/mpbelhhnfhfjnaehkcnnaknldmnocglk?hl=en-US).


## Linux Environment Setup

  If you are on a Apple OSX machine, you don't need to do this step.  
  
  If you are on Windows 10, please setup Windows Subsystem Ubuntu 18.04 Linux on your machine.

  1. Install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on Your Windows 10 machine (10 min).  This is meant for those that wish to stay with Windows 10.  You can have bite of both worlds, Windows and Linux.  Ask instructor help if necessary.  [Suggested Instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)


## Apps Installations

App installations would be done in class.  If you are comfortable with installing apps, you may install these on your own at home.
  
  1. #### Chrome browser : if you don't have Chrome, please install it from Google Chrome's website.
  1. #### VSCode (editor) [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
  1. #### Git Command Line: This is pre-installed on Mac OSX.  Those with Mac OSX machines may skip this bullet.  
    
      Note: do not install the Github Desktop, Atlassian Sourcetree or another Git client just yet.  We only need the command line version now.  

      **Mac OSX**:

      Your computer has this installed by default.  You may skip git installation.

      **Windows 10**:

      Please check if git comes with your computer using the command:

        ```git --version```

      If it is installed, it would provide a version.

      If not installed, your options depend upon using WSL Ubuntu Linux (see above) or not.  Choose the appropriate installation instructions at the site below for your system.
