### Trying to Understand Git?  

1. **Git Reference**
  
    You must check out the https://git-scm.com/ website.  It has a lot of really good learning resources.  Don't try to learn all of it at once.  It is overwhelming.
  
    Also, make a book mark and check out the Git e-Book.  I found this to be a great way to learn quickly.

    Don't fret.  It will take a review of Git from many angles to finally grok it.  For this week, read some excellent explanations [here on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3329943/git-branch-fork-fetch-merge-rebase-and-clone-what-are-the-differences/).  Don't worry if you don't understand EVERYTHING on this discussion.  


2. **Fetch and Pull**

    A good topic for research and discussion with the class, is the question of what's the difference between ```git pull``` and ```git fetch```.  Try it. 


3. **The issues with StackOverflow (SO)** (and the beauty of it): 

    Not everything that is posted on SO is true or accurate.  There is so much that is not accurate that as a student you might sometimes feel lost.  What are the options before you?  Some ideas might include .. 
  
    **The beauty of SO**
  
    Take a look at the rating of each answer.  It has to exceed a certain threshold before you believe it implicitly. You decide if you believe it.  If you don't, feel free to do more research.

    **Compare what you know with what you read:**
  
    Take notes of everything you learn, so you can quickly compare between what you have learnt and what you are reading right now.  Use a consistent place to put all your **Lessons Learnt** and syntax of each command you learnt.  I like Evernote, since it is quite generous with its free offer and works on most devices, even the browser.  If using Evernote, install the browser extension, so you can save pages that you really like.
  
## Job Search

The following publication from LinkedIn University as some good tips about job search. I liked their simple tips for creating your LI profile.

[Review Job Hunting Handbook, by LinkedIn, Vol 1](https://university.linkedin.com/content/dam/students/global/en_US/site/img/StudentPublishMicroSite/pdfs/LNK_MM_JobSeeker_eBook_StudentEdition_Sec1_FINAL.pdf)

**Blogging**: 

It is a great tool to prove that you know your stuff.  
  - Search for top rated blogging providers, select one and start your blog.  Some of them are tumblr, [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com
), blogspot, medium and wordpress.com.
  - Create your blog about your Bootcamp Learning Journey. Share it with others.
  - Post an entry every week or 10 days.
  - Blogging ideas
    - Documenting my journey as a Newbie Developer.  Remember that thousands of folks are undertaking this journey everywhere.  Make it useful for them.
    - Setting up my Development Environment.  Your dev environment is one of the most critical assets you have.  And this is not going to be static.  It will evolve along with your evolution.  Keeping a running blog acts as a dignified note of what you are using, why and how are you establishing your development workflow.
