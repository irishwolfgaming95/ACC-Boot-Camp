  1. How to link files and external websites

A website devoted to the founder and former CEO of Apple Inc., Steve Jobs. This project will help you gain experience in writing links in HTML.

- [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II)

- [Pixar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar)

- [Steve was a fantastic salesman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field)

- [Remembering Steve](http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/)

- [The Steve Jobs Biography](https://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537)

- [The Steve Jobs Movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2080374/)


There are three Youtube videos at the bottom the page. Here are the links:
