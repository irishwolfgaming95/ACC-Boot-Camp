## Project 3

### Learning Goal

  1. Forms

  **The Breakfast Restaurant**

A website for a restaurant that only serves breakfast.

You’ll need to have three separate HTML files. The images are located in a sub-folder called “img”.

The idea is to practice linking between separate files, as well as accessing files located in different folders (images in this case.)

The completed pages would look like ...

### Page 1 - The Breakfast Restaurant

<img src="./Project3Page1.png" width=90% style="border:1px solid black">

### Page 2 - The Menu

<img src="./Project3Page2.png" width=90% style="border:1px solid black">

### Page 3 - Contact Us
