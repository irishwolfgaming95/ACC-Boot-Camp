        <h1>Oh, so your a programmer now, huh?</h1>

        <p>Welcome to programming, the most lucrative career in the world.</p>

You can create your own websites, social networks, mobile apps and even games. You have the ability to create systems and environments that can reach potentially millions of people online. No other time in human history has such a thing been possible. We are truly living in the future, my friends, and I am happy to have you be part of it.</p>
